# Auction Service
A simple app that allows user to create auctions and make bids on them. This uses [Serverless](https://www.serverless.com/) to deploy everything on AWS.\
This was made while I was going through the course [Serverless Framework Bootcamp: Node.js, AWS & Microservices](https://www.udemy.com/course/serverless-framework/) on Udemy.
